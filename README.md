Note - the original reward system is unstable. 
For now, I am using a simple reward system that gives a reward of 1 for every step taken.  

It is a mess but I will clean up after I get it working.  
Relevant files: model.py, scripts.py, train.py, agent.py and game_env.py

The goal was to learn how to make an application specific AI agent trained with reinforcement learning  
A lot of optimization was done with GitHub Copilot. In the draft written completely by me I averaged at < 1 fps severly bottlenecking my training.
